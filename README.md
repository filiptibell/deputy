## Why "Deputy"?

This project was previously called "Tooling Language Server", but I felt it was a bit too generic and verbose.

Deputy is mostly just a fun wordplay on "Dependency" and "Utility", but you can also interpret it using the literal meaning of the word. <br/>
Deputy helps you (the sheriff of dependencies) stay informed, and keep your versions up to date. ðŸ¤
