# Aftman LSP

A language server for [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).

This is mostly a small personal project to learn how to write a performant language server and lexer/parser for TOML files.

Will support:

- Diagnostics for invalid tool names and/or versions, unsupported platform
- Autocomplete for tools under a specific GitHub user or organization
- Quick actions for upgrading to a newer version of a tool
