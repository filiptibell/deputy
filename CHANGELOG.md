# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added syntax highlighting and language support for [Zap](https://github.com/red-blox/zap)
- Added back support for [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGHatguy/aftman)
- Added an extension for the [Zed code editor](https://zed.dev/).

## `0.4.0` - January 7th, 2025

Version `0.4.0` refactors JSON and TOML parsing to use [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) instead of a custom parser.
This means that the language server now handles errors & invalid syntax in both JSON and TOML much more gracefully.
More specifically, it will now provide most services (hover, completion, diagnostics) even if the file does not fully parse ðŸš€

### Added

- Added support for more kinds of links in hovers (Wally homepage and repository fields + more)
- Added support for merging of package scopes when using private Wally registries, matching Wally behavior
- Added support for completions even in files that would not normally parse, eg:

  ```toml
  # Cargo.toml

  [dependencies]
  tok|
  ```

  The language server will now complete "tokio" and various other packages at the `|` cursor!

### Changes

- Various performance improvements across the board for faster diagnostics and hover responsiveness
- Links, versions, and other information in hovers are now _much_ more consistent and look the same across Cargo, NPM, Rokit, and Wally

### Fixes

- Fixed missing hovers, completions, diagnostics, when using version specifiers and ranges like `"^x.y.z"`, `">=x.y.z"`, ...
- Fixed invalid diagnostics for newer versions being available when using `x.y.z-additional-info.1` and similar specifiers
- Fixed duplicate diagnostics and a couple other race conditions related to file opening
- Fixed invalid error diagnostics for NPM package names & others
- Other miscellaneous fixes, check GitHub issues and git history for more

### Breaking Changes

[Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman) and [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman) are no longer supported - due to the language server now being streamlined and providing more consistent features across all different tooling it supports.
Supporting both Aftman and Foreman would add a non-trivial amount of complexity with all of the changes in this version, and [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) can replace both of them while keeping full compatibility.
